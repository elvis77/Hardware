Hardware
========

This repository contains pcb layout files for the reembox project.

The layout files can be opened with [EAGLE](http://www.cadsoft.de/download-eagle/) version 6.4.0 or higher. Since the board fits on a half eurocard, you can use EAGLE in the freeware version without buying a licence.

Check out the [Wiki documentation](https://github.com/reembox/Hardware/wiki) for setting it up.
